        <h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
        <p>The primary purpose of hotels is to provide travellers with shelter, food, refreshment, and similar services and goods, offering on commercial basis things that are customarily furnished within households but unavailable to people on a journey away from home.<br>

            A hotel is a managed building or establishment, which provides guests with a place to stay overnight – on a short-term basis – in exchange for money. The precise features and services provided to guests can vary quite drastically from one hotel to another, and hotel owners generally aim to attract a particular type of customer through their pricing model and marketing strategy, or via the range of services they offer.<br>
            
            For hotels to sustain a profitable revenue stream there are many factors they must maintain. One of those is their online presence and reputation – and the clearest indicator of a hotel’s reputation is often found in online reviews.<br>
            
            Review websites can have a significant impact on how travellers choose their accommodation. Most of the time, the general consensus is what people will accept so it’s vital that your hotel has a reputation for quality service and professional standards.<br>
            
            This website aims at providing hotel reviews along with their prices which allows users to compare hotel deals and find the best prices quickly and easily.
